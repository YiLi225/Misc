Python snippets for Your Next NLP Projects

This project will use the WikiText data from Layer.ai as sample texts and present various useful Python snippets for text mining and NLP projects. 

1.	Spell checker with the {spellchecker} library
2.	Fuzzy string matching with the {fuzzywuzzy} library 
3.	Simple metrics about text data with the {textstat} library
4.	Generate a world cloud
5.	Semantic similarity analysis with transformer 
6.	Next word prediction with BERT model 
7.	NER with {spacy} and negation detection 
8.	(optional) useful Regular Expression snippets

The goal is to provide the audience with small nuggets that will come in handy for their future NLP problems. 
I may change the order depending on the flow.
